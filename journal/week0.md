# Billing, Budget Cost Explorer and Billing Alarm
* As the first task to do which is done with my Root User account, I was able to create a zero-spend budget.
* I setup a Billing alarm which an alert was sent via email notification and this helps in Cost Management.
* This is to help track spending while provisioning and deploying resources.

# Creating a IAM User, and MFA
* I created a User to enable me stop using my Root account, added a MFA and granted the User Administrative access.

## Installing CLI

* It is shown below.
